                    That night, some shepherds were in the fields. Suddenly, an angel appeared among them and said to them, "Don't be afraid! I bring joyful news: the Saviour has been born tonight in Bethlehem! How will you recognize him? You will find a baby wrapped in a blanket, lying in a manger!"
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    The shepherds ran to the village and found their way to Mary and Joseph. And there was the baby, lying in the manger. 
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    The shepherds told everyone what had happened and what the angel had said to them about this child. 
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    All who heard the shepherd's story expressed astonishment. Then they returned to their sheep, praising God for sending his Son to be their Saviour.

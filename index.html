            Around 2000 years ago, God sent the angel Gabriel to Mary. Mary was a virgin engaged to marry Joseph. The angel said to her, 'God has given you a baby boy, and you will call him Jesus. He will be God's own Son and his kingdom will never end.' At the same time, Joseph had to go register at a town called Bethlehem in Judea. So Joseph and Mary made a long journey to Bethlehem, and Mary was pregnant with Jesus.
